# RoBat Robot Construction Kit #

RoBat is a great robot kit with which you can build your own robot. It's easy and you can design your robot according to your ideas. The instructions explain how to use the kit.

The instructions are for a wheeled robot. You can either control it yourself with a small joystick or let it find its own way.

In contrast to many other robot kits, Robat does not have a specified chassis. On the one hand, this would make it easier to set up, but on the other hand it would limit the possibilities. With a piece of sturdy cardboard and a hot glue gun you can easily build your own chassis.

Please find the RoBat manual in https://github.com/merlanura/robat/blob/master/documentation/robat_anleitung_v03.pdf

Have fun!
